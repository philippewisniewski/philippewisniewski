# Hi, I'm Philippe 👋

Frontend developer building for the web. I specialise in modern JavaScript, headless CMS architectures, and API integrations, bringing a design-first approach to everything I build.

## What I'm working with

- **JavaScript (ES6+)** - my primary language
- **React** - building modern frontend applications
- **WordPress & Eleventy** - building headless CMS solutions
- **JAMstack** - modern web architectures

## Currently exploring

- 🤖 How AI is transforming software development (prompt engineering, LLM workflows)
- ⚛️ React patterns and state management through hands-on projects
- 📚 JavaScript fundamentals (currently working through Crockford's "JavaScript: The Good Parts")
- 🛠️ Integrating tools like Claude Code into development workflows

## Background

Started in design, working on web and UX, progressed into full-stack development. I've built e-commerce platforms, headless CMS websites, interactive learning applications, and everything in between. Recently completed Meta's React Basics and Programming with JavaScript certificates.

## When I'm not coding

🏃 Running trails • 🧠 Learning about emerging tech • ☕ Probably drinking coffee
